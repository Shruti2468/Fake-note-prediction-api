# Fake-note-prediction-api
This repository contains a FastAPI application for banknote authentication. The application utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model to classify banknotes as "Fake" or "Real" based on their features. The model is trained to predict the authenticity of banknotes based on various characteristics, such as variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy.
